# snapd

Snapd is a universal package manager for Linux that works across multiple
distributions and provides confined apps with transactional updates and
well-defined communications and integration mechanisms between them.

Take a tour of the snap experience at https://snapcraft.io/ or learn to
create your own snap at https://snapcraft.io/create/

Snaps are installed with a single command and then updated automatically.
Apps are stored compressed to use disk space efficiently. Updates are
transactional and failed updates are rolled back automatically, making
keeping the system healthy and making snaps a great choice for unattended
devices.

You can install the stable, candidate, beta or edge version of a snap in
order to follow upstream development as closely as you prefer. Snaps can
often be forked so you can install a specific developer's version if you
prefer.

The snapcore team leads development of snapd on Github, fork us there or
find us on Freenode in #snapcraft

## Development

Snapd is free software written in Go, making it nice and snappy.

### Setting up a GOPATH

When working with the source of Go programs, you should define a path within
your home directory (or other workspace) which will be your `GOPATH`.
`GOPATH` is similar to Java's `CLASSPATH` or Python's `~/.local`. `GOPATH`
is documented [http://golang.org/pkg/go/build/](online) and inside the go
tool itself

    go help gopath

Various conventions exist for naming the location of your `GOPATH`, but it
should exist, and be writable by you. For example

    export GOPATH=${HOME}/work
    mkdir -p $GOPATH

will define and create `$HOME/work` as your local `GOPATH`. The `go` tool
itself will create three subdirectories inside your `GOPATH` when required;
`src`, `pkg` and `bin`, which hold the source of Go programs, compiled
packages and compiled binaries, respectively.

Setting `GOPATH` correctly is critical when developing Go programs. Set and
export it as part of your login script.

Add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH`, so you can run the go programs you install:

    PATH="$PATH:$GOPATH/bin"

### Getting the snapd source

The easiest way to get the source for `snapd` is to use the `go get` command.

    go get -v github.com/snapcore/snapd/...

This command will checkout the source, download any unmet Go package
dependencies, and build and install them all. To checkout without
installing, use the `-d` flag. See `go help get` for more options.

At this point you will have the git local repository of the `snapd` source
at `$GOPATH/github.com/snapcore/snapd`. The source for any dependent
packages will also be available inside `$GOPATH`.

### Dependency handling

To generate dependencies.tsv you need `godeps`, so

    go get launchpad.net/godeps

To obtain the correct dependencies for the project, run:

    godeps -t -u dependencies.tsv

You can use the script `get-deps.sh` to run the two previous steps.

If the dependencies need updating

    godeps -t ./... > dependencies.tsv

### Building

Once the sources are available and `GOPATH` is set, you can just run

    go build -o /tmp/snap github.com/snapcore/snapd/cmd/snap

to get the `snap` binary in /tmp (or without -o to get it in the current
working directory). Alternatively:

    go install github.com/snapcore/snapd/...

to have it available in `$GOPATH/bin`

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Please sign the contributor
agreement at http://www.ubuntu.com/legal/contributors

Snapd can be found on Github, so in order to fork the source and contribute,
go to https://github.com/snapcore/snapd. Check out [Github's help
pages](https://help.github.com/) to find out how to set up your local
branch, commit changes and create pull requests.

We value good tests, so when you fix a bug or add a new feature we highly
encourage you to create a test in $source_testing.go.

### Tests

To run the various tests:

    ./run-checks

This will check if the source format is consistent, that it builds, that all
tests work as expected and that "go vet" and "golint" have no complaints.

You can run individual test for a sub-package by changing into that directory and:

    go test -check.f $testname

If a test hangs, you can enable verbose mode:

    go test -v -check.vv

(or -check.v for less verbose output).

There is more to read about the testing framework on the [website](https://labix.org/gocheck)

### Running the spread tests

To run the spread tests locally you need the latest version of spread
from https://github.com/snapcore/spread. It can be installed via:

    $ sudo apt install qemu-kvm autopkgtest
    $ sudo snap install spread

Then setup the environment via:

    $ mkdir -p .spread/qemu
    $ cd .spread/qemu
    $ adt-buildvm-ubuntu-cloud
    $ mv adt-xenial-amd64-cloud.img ubuntu-16.04.img

And you can run the tests via:

    $ spread -v qemu:

For quick reuse you can use:

    $ spread -keep qemu:

It will print how to reuse the systems. Make sure to use
`export REUSE_PROJECT=1` in your environment too.


### Testing snapd on a classic system

To test the `snapd` REST API daemon on a snappy system you need to
transfer it to the snappy system and then run:

    sudo systemctl stop snapd.service snapd.socket
    sudo /lib/systemd/systemd-activate -E SNAPD_DEBUG=1 -l /run/snapd.socket ./snapd

This will stop the installed snapd and activate the new one. Once it's
printed out something like `Listening on /run/snapd.socket as 3.` you
should then

    sudo chmod 0666 /run/snapd.socket

so the socket has the right permissions (otherwise you need `sudo` to
connect).
